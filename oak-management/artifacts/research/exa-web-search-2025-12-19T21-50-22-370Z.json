Thank you so much for your appreciation for the site (except that one guy who hated it). Pretty awesome to see this little side project make it to the front page on here. I'm working on a new project called Feel ( [https://www.feelapp.io](https://www.feelapp.io)) which is an app that helps you feel all emotions on demand. It goes beyond just crying and helps you navigate and shift your mood in real time. It can make you cry too though. Or feel joy, awe, confidence, serenity, or even process difficult emotions like anger or fear when you need to. This isn't an ad or shameless plug I promise - I'm actually looking for a creative developer to join the team and help us take it to the next level. Please reach out if this resonates with you or share with your creative coder\n\nTitle: The Humane Space - Unlock the power of curiosity and awe.\nAuthor: \nPublished Date: 2023-01-03T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/\nText: [Download the App](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/the-humane-space-one.webflow.io)\n\n[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/uy/app/the-humane-space/id6443709613)\n\n/\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thehumanespace.app)\n\n[About](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/about)\n\n/\n\n[Ideas](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/blog-posts/the-chaos-of-it-all)\n\n/\n\n[FAQ](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/help)\n\n/\n\n[Connect](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/connect)\n\n[\\+ Menu](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/the-humane-space-one.webflow.io)\n\n[<  Back](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/the-humane-space-one.webflow.io)\n\n[home](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/) [About](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow.io/about)\n\n[ideas](https://the-humane-space-one.webflow\n\nTitle: How Awe Can Change Your Life | Dacher Keltner\nAuthor: \nPublished Date: 2023-07-06T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/how-awe-can-change-your-life-dacher-keltner/\nText: Wondering what to do with your life?

After all, it’s a little square that I tap on my phone that opens up a program. How special could one of those be? Very special, it turns out. Given the fact that I have anxiety, I’m highly introverted, and I generally go through a lot of life struggles, apps on my phone have made help easy to access and impossible to ignore (no matter how hard I try).
