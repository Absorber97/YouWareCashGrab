I think I’ve learned a bunch from this\nexercise. This is frustrating! I don’t want to learn by trial and\nerror, I’d rather read someone’s blog post with lessons learned.\nSadly, _most_ of the writing on the topic that percolates to me\ntends to be high-level — easy to nod along while reading, but hard to\nextract actionable lessons.

Vibe coding is an AI-assisted way of programming where you describe a problem or application in natural language and let an AI system generate the code to solve it. In practice, this means you tell the computer what you want in simple terms — for example, “I need a webpage that shows a friendly welcome message and today’s date” — and the AI will try to write the necessary code for you. Vibe coding shifts the role of the programmer from writing detailed code to guiding the AI with high-level instructions and ideas.
