And I started thinking about post launch activities, so naturally product hunt was on my radar, but... \n I was wondering if people still think it's valuable to launch their product on product hunt in 2024, it seems like it's a highly competitive space nowadays with limited chance for visibility. (But I could be totally wrong) \n If you have any experience with product hunt launches, I want to know more! :) Let me know how it went for you and if you saw any value come out of it. \n\n\nTitle: Ranking 1st on Product Hunt as a solopreneur - 15 key lessons\nAuthor: Saïd\nPublished Date: 2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/ranking-1st-on-product-hunt-as-a-solopreneur-15-key-lessons-f62b4313c8\nText: [25\\\n\\\nLikes](https://www.indiehackers.com/sign-up)\n\n11Bookmarks[20\\\nComments](https://www.indiehackers.com/sign-in)\n\nReport\n\n## Launch Day\n\nI did post on Indie Hackers a month ago to share the idea-to-MVP journey that took me exactly 1 month and was starting to get decent traction on social media.\n\nThe platform I'm shipping is called [Microlaunch](https://microlaunch.net): you launch products, get feedback, traction and ideally first customers over a month. It's used complementarily to Product Hunt, either before or after it.\n\nMy Product launch for Microlaunch was scheduled for a Tuesday and it was frankly a super competitive day: one of my competitors was Claude 3 by Anthropic😅\n\nWe managed to win the competition, thanks to the amazing indie maker\n\nTitle: First time launching my app on Product Hunt - Indie Hackers\nAuthor: Alen Varaždinac\nPublished Date: 2024-06-09T11:17:35.000Z\nURL: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/first-time-launching-my-app-on-product-hunt-4bed553c41\nText: Hello Indie Hackers, \n Quick story about me: \nI lost my job as a frontend developer on 1st of April and decided it is a perfect moment to start creating something on my own. Firstly, I decided to offer coaching to other developers and after that, web development services to businesses. Neither of those didn't go well since I am not really good at getting leads. And there was only one thing left before I must look for a job again, and that is to build my own application. But I was always intimitated to release an app on Product Hunt and to share my application everywhere because I am aware that a lot of other applications created are much better than mine. Until I stumbled upon videos of a SaaS maker Marc Lou, which motivated me to launch an application on \n\nTitle: This Solo Developer Built 3 Six-Figure Apps in 18 Months (Here's ...\nPublished Date: 2025-06-26T12:19:27.000Z\nURL: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/this-solo-developer-built-3-six-figure-apps-in-18-months-here-s-his-secret-weapon-f37228724c\nText: This Solo Developer Built 3 Six-Figure Apps in 18 Months (Here's His Secret Weapon) - Indie Hackers\n[](https://www.indiehackers.com/plus)\n[Join](https://www.indiehackers.com/sign-up)\n[\n2\nLikes\n](https://www.indiehackers.com/sign-up)\n0Bookmarks[0Comments](https://www.indiehackers.com/sign-in)\nReport\n# This Solo Developer Built 3 Six-Figure Apps in 18 Months (Here's His Secret Weapon)\nby[John Daniel M](https://www.indiehackers.com/johndanielm1999)\n**Fellow indie hackers, stop me if this sounds familiar:**\nYou've got killer app ideas brewing in your head, but you're stuck in development hell.

It solves a real problem. Now what?\n\nFor many solo developers, launching the app is the easy part. Marketing it is where things get uncomfortable. But if you want users, sales or traction, marketing isn’t optional. The good news is you don’t need a big budget or a dedicated team. You just need a plan, some consistency and a little creativity.\n\nHere’s a tactical guide to help solo developers launch and market their apps without feeling like a full-time salesperson.\n\n**Start with positioning**\n\nBefore you do any outreach, clarify what your app is, who it’s for and why it matters.
