This approach has yielded key findings in the psychological literature yet may not represent how people typically describe their experiences. We used an alternative approach, in which participants labeled their current emotion with at least one word of their choosing. In an initial study, estimates of label positivity recapitulated momentary valence ratings and were associated with self-reported mental health. The number of unique emotion words used over time was related to the balance and spread of emotions endorsed in an end-of-day rating task, but not to other measures of emot\n\nTitle: Editorial: The role of emotional granularity in emotional regulation ...\nAuthor: Yasemin Erbas, Maria Gendron, Jennifer M.

This phrase gives voice to the common-sense belief that articulating feelings is a more measured and mature way of coping and navigating social relationships than is either suppressing those feelings or acting on them through other (more problematic) behavioral means. Labeling emotions with words like “angry”, “sad”, or “worried” is an efficient means of sharing one’s perspective with others (Wood, Lupyan, & Niedenthal, 2016): Such labels communicate not only how one feels, but why one might feel that way, what might be done about i\n\nTitle: Psychological Resilience and Positive Emotional Granularity - NIH\nAuthor: \nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1201429/\nText: [Skip to main content](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#main-content)\n\n**Official websites use .gov**\nA\n**.gov** website belongs to an official\ngovernment organization in the United States.\n\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS**\nA **lock** (\n\nLocked padlock icon\n) or **https://** means you've safely\nconnected to the .gov website.

Lieberman\nPublished Date: 2018-04-01T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073917742706\nText: Abstract Putting feelings into words, or “affect labeling,” can attenuate our emotional experiences. However, unlike explicit emotion regulation techniques, affect labeling may not even feel like a regulatory process as it occurs. Nevertheless, research investigating affect labeling has found it produces a pattern of effects like those seen during explicit emotion regulation, suggesting affect labeling is a form of implicit emotion regulation. In this review, we will outline research on affect labeling, comparing it to reappraisal, a form of explicit emotion regulation, along four major domains of effects—experiential, autonomic, neural, and behavioral—that establish it as a form of implicit emotion regulation. This review will then speculate on possible mechanisms dri\n\n"
