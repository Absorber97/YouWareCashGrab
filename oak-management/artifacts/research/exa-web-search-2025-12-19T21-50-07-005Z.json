Sounds like a millennial buzzword, but it is an AI term that has been popularized by computer scientist, Andrej Karpathy, earlier this year, and…my most recent favorite pastime. As Wikipedia puts it, Vibe Coding describes a fast, improvisational, collaborative approach to creating software where the developer and a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding act rather like pair programmers in a conversational loop. Karpathy himself, who coined the term, described it as “fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists.” My definition: Anyone with an idea can now create that software with AI …And it’s much simpler than you would think.

This frees you up to think about the big picture, or the main goal of your app, while the AI handles writing the actual code.\nIn practice, vibe coding is generally applied in two main ways:\n* **\"Pure\" vibe coding:**In it\n\nTitle: Welcome to AI Coding Vibe: The Future of Coding, Powered by AI\nPublished Date: 2025-08-16T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://aicodingvibe.com/\nText: Welcome to AI Coding Vibe: The Future of Coding, Powered by AI\nWelcome to AI Coding Vibe: The Future of Coding, Powered by AI\nTransform your ideas into reality through conversation - no coding required.\n[\nStart Vibe Coding\n](https://www.aicodingvibe.com/signup)\n[\nTry Live Demo\n](https://www.aicodingvibe.com/demo)\nWhat is Vibe Coding?\nVibe coding represents a revolutionary paradigm shift in how we approach software development.
