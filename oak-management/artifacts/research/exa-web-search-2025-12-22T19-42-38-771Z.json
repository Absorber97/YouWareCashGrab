In fact, they focused on building a simple, well-designed meditation app that was top-notch.\n\nBut hey, this isn’t about seed funding or business growth. It’s a bunch of highlights of some cool (and maybe lesser-known) stunts Calm has pulled off in the past few years. This shows that its explosive growth was less about luck and more about smart choices.\n\n## The time Calm app went after elections\n\nNo need to remind us how hundreds of thousands of Americans were glued to their TVs in 2020 as the results from a super heated election started coming in.\n\nSome folks might have missed that while everyone was on the edge of their seats to see who’d become the 46th President of the U.S., Calm was seizing the moment to send out a chill vibe to viewers.\n\nIn a brilliant move, the startup snagged a sponsorship with CNN. They got prime screen real estate during the network’s election coverage.\n\nYup, there’s some next-level sarcasm and irony here: Calm’s logo chilling in the corner of the screen while CNN anchors Wolf Blitzer and \n\nTitle: Calm & Headspace: Driving The Mindfulness App Boom\nAuthor: Team TBH\nPublished Date: 2025-07-14T00:00:00.000Z\nURL: https://thebrandhopper.com/2025/07/14/calm-headspace-driving-the-mindfulness-app-boom/\nText: The app initially began as a simple relaxation tool, offering soundscapes and calming music. However, it quickly evolved into an immersive experience. Acton Smith and Tew introduced Sleep Stories, which became a hallmark of the Calm experience. Narrated by celebrities such as Matthew McConaughey, Harry Styles, and Stephen Fry, these stories were designed to help people wind down and fall asleep. The app’s tranquil design and luxurious feel positioned it as a premium product, attracting users who were looking for relaxation in a fast-paced world.\n\nBy 2020, Calm had been downloaded over 100 million times, and its paying subscriber base reached over 4 million$2 billion valuation made it one of the most successful wellness apps on the market. With a unique combination of sleep aid features, relaxation tools, and mindfulness content, Calm quickly became a household name.\n\n#### Technological Advancements: The Power of the Smartphone\n\nThe rise of Calm and Headspace could not have happened without the rise of the smartphone. The rapid adoption of smartphones in the 2010s made it possible for mindfulness apps to reach millions of users worldwide. Meditation, which was once reserved for retreats, classes, or personal experiences, could now be practiced from the comfort of one’s own home, office, or even while commuting.\n\nSmartphones provided a convenient, on-demand platform for meditation apps. Whether it was on the train, before bed, or during a lunch break, users could easily access a guided session at any time. The integration of push notifications allowed mindfulness apps to nudge users to meditate regularly, even in the midst of busy schedules.\n\nBy integrating features like personalized meditation plans, progress tracking, and reminders, apps like Calm and He\n\nTitle: Headspace vs Calm: I tested both to see which is best - Whop\nAuthor: Stowe Gregory\nPublished Date: 2025-01-03T18:00:39.000Z\nURL: https://whop.com/blog/headspace-vs-calm/\nText: [Skip to main content](https://whop.com/whop.com#main-content)\n\n## Menu\n\n[Go to Whop](https://whop.com/) [Start selling for free](https://whop.com/sell/)\n\n[Apps](https://whop.com/blog/t/apps/)\n\n# Headspace vs Calm: I tested both to see which is best\n\nBy[Stowe Gregory](https://whop.com/blog/author/stoweg/)\n\n#### [Stowe Gregory](https://whop.com/blog/author/stoweg/)\n\nStowe is a British writer with nearly a decade of experience writing guides and insights on various fields from art to ecommerce.
