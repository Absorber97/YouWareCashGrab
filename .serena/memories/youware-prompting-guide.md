## Core Philosophy
- You are the art director, not the mechanic
- Talk to AI clearly and simply - no jargon needed
- The AI is a brilliant but literal artist; your words are the direction

## Three Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Start with the Feeling, Not the Features
- Describe the VIBE before listing features
- Question: "How do you want people to FEEL?"
- Bad: "I need a header, three-column layout, footer"
- Good: "I want it to feel like a cozy, rainy-day bookstore - warm, inviting, nostalgic"

### Rule 2: Tell a Story, from Beginning to End
Think in chapters, not sections:
1. The Hook - grand opening, capture attention
2. The Why - why should they care?
3. The Proof - show, don't tell (gallery, testimonials)
4. The Invitation - what do you want them to do?

### Rule 3: Sculpt, Don't Command
- First result is clay, refine piece by piece
- Don't start over - build on what's there
- Be conversational: "That's good, but..." "I like that, can we try..."
- Focus on one thing at a time

## Prompt Templates

### Initial Vibe
"I want to create [TYPE] for [PURPOSE]. The feeling should be [ADJ], [ADJ], and [ADJ]. Imagine [SENSORY ANALOGY]. The design should feel [POSITIVE], not [NEGATIVE]."

### Story Structure
"Let's build this like a story. **First,** [HOOK]. **Next,** [WHY]. **After that,** [PROOF]. **Finally,** [INVITATION]."

### Refinement
"This is a [POSITIVE] start! Let's refine:
1. The [ELEMENT] feels [ISSUE]. Can you [CHANGE]?
2. In [SECTION], can you [ENHANCEMENT]?
3. Could we try [ALTERNATIVE]?"
